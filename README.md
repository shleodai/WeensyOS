WeensyOSVM is a full operating system for x86-64 machines that fits in one directory, supporting virtual memory. 

This project extended the functionality of an existing operating system, WeensyOS, created by Eddie Kohler, to include a robust virtual memory system. The primary objective was to update the implementation of the page table to ensure complete and correct memory isolation between processes.

See README-OS.md for information on how to run WeensyOSVM.
